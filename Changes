Revision history for Perl extension Class::Framework.

0.01_05  Fri May 10 15:29:46 EST 2002
 - If a container has two contained classes that both need to see the a
   parameter of the same name, it will now be passed to both.  Previously
   it was passed to one of them, randomly.

 - Added 2 tests for the above.

 - Added 4 tests to make sure class names can be properly overridden.

 - Got rid of _make_contained_object() method.

 - Changed the (undocumented) get_contained_objects() method to
   get_contained_object_spec().

 - Added the container() method, to get a reference to the thingy that
   created you.  Uses weak references if Scalar::Util is available.

 - Consolidated all Container metadata in $self->{container} (subject to
   change to {_container} or something).

 - Added call_method() method.

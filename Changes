Revision history for Perl extension Class::Framework.

 - Add the show_containers() method, which should be a godsend during
   debugging.

 - Convert contained_objects() string specs to hashes upon input, rather
   than checking them every time they're used later in the code.

 - Change " if (%args)" to " if (keys %args)", which is more officially
   correct (though both would work in this particular case).

 - Subclasses can now override contained_objects settings of their
   superclass (previously it was backwards).

 - Let call_method() accept arbitrary additional parameters, don't
   force them into a hash.

 - Added contained_class() method.

 - Use new contained_class() method inside call_method().

 - delayed_object_class() shouldn't be settable, it'll mess up the
   parameters accepted.

 - The 'container' parameter shouldn't be shared among containers the way
   other parameters are.

 - Made create_delayed_object() a little more efficient by not shifting
   things off @_ - just pass @_ to the next new() method.

 - Don't check for $contained_class->can('allowed_params'), check for
   $contained_class->isa(__PACKAGE__).

 - Clarified a few error messages.

 - Clarified documentation and removed a couple of doc errors.

 - Made Scalar::Util a little more optional - the container() method
   is just a no-op if it's not around.

 - Use Params::Validate 0.18 new validate_with() method to set a
   meaningful subroutine name in error messages

 - Added the delayed_object_class() method

 - Documented how delayed objects are declared and created [Dave
   Rolsky]

 - Added some tests for the above stuff

 - Various documentation spruce-ups

 - If a container has two contained classes that both need to see a
   parameter of the same name, it will now be passed to both.  Previously
   it was passed to one of them, randomly.

 - Added 2 tests for the above.

 - Added 4 tests to make sure class names can be properly overridden.

 - Got rid of _make_contained_object() method.

 - Changed the (undocumented) get_contained_objects() method to
   get_contained_object_spec().

 - Added the container() method, to get a reference to the thingy that
   created you.  Uses weak references if Scalar::Util is available.

 - Consolidated all Container metadata in $self->{container} (subject to
   change to {_container} or something).

 - Added call_method() method.
